•	Upgrade to .NET 7.0

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5.0.0

•	Replaced the FIX Repository based dictionary with one generated from the FIX Orchestra.
	- Fields with with multi character enumerated values are now fully supported.
	- FIX.4.0, FIX.4.2, FIX.4.4, and FIX.5.0SP2 (FixLatest) are now the only included orchestrations.
		- FIX.4.2, FIX.4.4, and FIX.5.0SP2 are the only versions now supported by fixtrading.org.
		- FIX.4.0 has been generated in order to support custom ITG/Virtu message types.
	- Data dictionary customisation for HKEX message and field types has been removed.
•	The messages view data dictionary panel now displays the complete pedigree for each message, field, and value.
•	Removed the smart paste options from the messages view paste form.
•	The default SenderCompID and TargetCompID for a new session is now INITIATOR/ACCEPTOR.
•	The format of the session *.filters file has been changed to simplify it and improve performance.
	- Existing filters will be ignored and the file will be rewritten.
•	The libraries FIX Client is built upon Fix, Fix.Dictionary, and Fix.Common are now available from nuget.
	- The nuget packages are named Geh.Fix, Geh.Fix.Dictionary, and Geh.Fix.Common to make then unique in the repository.
•	The history view now has a data dictionary inspector like the messages view.
•	Fixed a null reference exception that would intermittently cause crashes.

•	Moved to .NET 5.0 and publish as a single file application.
•	Removed the old WIX installers.
•	Removed the trades view - this was a special case and only ever partially implemented.

•	CustomFields.xml is now embedded in the binary so it doesn't have to be distributed seperately.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.31.0		2016/01/29

•	Changed fix message body length comparison from string to numeric
	- This came up during testing of a Fix 5 connection
•	When you reset a session, options are presented to retain active GTC and GTD orders.
	- It is probably a good idea to be using the option to append the date to ClOrdIDs if you retain orders
	  across resets or strange things may happen.
•	When you reset a session an option is presented to not reset generated IDs such as ClOrdID.
	- This is useful when resetting intraday.
•	Added a TIF column to the grid in the Orders and Parser views.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.30.0		2015/11/04

•	There is now a session option to append the current local date to generated ClOrdIDs.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.26.0		2015/07/20

•	Added a new view called Trades which is similar to the Orders view but it processes TradeCaptureReport messages.
	- This is fairly minimal at the moment and has been built to support the functionality needed to test GATE with
	  HKEX TradeCaptureReports.
	- It supports rejecting a TradeCaptureReport with a TradeCaptureReportAck or replying with another TradeCaptureReport.
	- If a TradeCaptureReport contains two sides then two separate entries will be created in the Trades grid, you can 
	  select one or both of these when sending the reply. 
	- The reply button will only be enabled if all selected rows have the same TradeReportID.
•	Added message options to automatic incrementing of TradeId and TradeReportId.
•	The HKEX custom field and enumeration ExchangeTradeType is now injected into the data dictionary.
•	The orders view can now be searched.
•	The parser order view search now works correctly for orders with an implied status of Pending.

•	Fixed a bug that would prevent connections when running as a server and a connection attempt is cancelled.

	- Fix.Dictionary.Fields["OrderQty"]

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.22.0		2015/06/15

	- Nested repeating groups are indicated with successively darker shades of gray.
	- Custom fields have no indent data so they use the indent level of the previous field in the message.
•	Fixed a bug that would prevent the history and order views from being populated when running as an Acceptor.
•	Fixed an exception that would occur if you try to action an order with no Side from the orders view.
•	Fixed the values generated for Message.Field.Indent in the data dictionary.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	Fixed an exception that could occur when attempting to write the *.filters file which would cause the 
	session to disconnect.
•	Fixed an exception caused by clicking in the description cell of a custom field in the message editor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3.18.0		2015/02/25

•	Improved the performance of the data dictionary.
•	The data dictionary is now primed in the background to improve performance with newer FIX versions that 
	have messages with a ridiculous number of fields. You may notice elevated CPU usage for 30 seconds or so
	after the FIX Client first loads while this happens.
•	Added search fields to the filter view.
•	When configured as a server and the session is disconnected, automatically start listening for incoming 
	connections again.
•	Numerous performance improvements in the GUI.
•	Grid sorting can now be undone by ctrl clicking a column header.
•	Fixed a bug that could cause messages to be written to the session history file in the wrong order.

•	The messages view message and field grids now have separate toolbars to make their function clearer.
•	You can now define custom fields that use tags in gaps in the data dictionary field sequence.
•	When pasting a message into the editor you will now be prompted with several options.
	- Automatically define unknown tags as custom fields.
	- Filter empty fields.
	- Smart paste
		- Reset the message before pasting the new values.
		- Attempt to process repeating groups, this is a best effort and crazy field orders may produce
		  strange results.
    - If you disable smart paste the message will be pasted in directly without trying to populate all
	  the fields in the data dictionary definition for the affected message. This is how paste has worked
	  in recent versions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

•	When processing NextExpectedMsgSeqNum don't expect the remote end to send a TestRequest after a resend.

•	Fixed a bug in the order view that caused cancelled orders to have a status of pending cancel replace.
•	Selecting a group of fields in the message order in bottom up order and then using the context menu to repeat or

•	The history view now displays the MsgSeqNum for all messages 
•	The data dictionary view now uses a different website as the fixprotocol.org site is a broken mess. 
•	You can now define any tag you like in the customise view including existing FIX tags. This lets you add 
	arbitrary fields to any message. Eg you can define a custom field for 447 and add it to an OrderSingle
