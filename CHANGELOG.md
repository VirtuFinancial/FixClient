* First open source version.
* Moved to .NET 5.0 and publish as a single file application.
* Removed the old WIX installers.
* Removed the trades view - this was a special case and only ever partially implemented.
* Hide the data dictionary view - this is broken and will be replaced.
* CustomFields.xml is now embedded in the binary so it doesn't have to be distributed seperately.
